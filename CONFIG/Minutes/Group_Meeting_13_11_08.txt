Josh and Lewis both have informed us that they will not be attending this meeting for legitimate reasons.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
The Gantt Chart need updating with extra milestones, and more detail (possibly on a per team member basis)
Mariya hasn't received the final documentation to complete the merging of the 1st part of the Design document. (Received towards the end of the meeting)
Neil asked about the Test Spec. Jack informed him that he had seen a draft of the test spec the meeting before, and that he had suggested improvements which were being implemented. Neil remembered this.
Everyone then informed Neil about what they were currently working on.
Neil was highly critical of the quality of communication within the group, and suggested that we needed a total plan of who is doing which bit of all documentation, possible integrated into the Gantt chart.
Neil finished the meeting by reaffirming to us that everyone needs to put up a blog post every week to make sure that everyone is working on something.

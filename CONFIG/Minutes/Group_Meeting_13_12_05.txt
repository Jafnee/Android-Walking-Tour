 Reviewed design specification standards document:
 
 Main issue, identifier names are not consistent; different identifier names are referring to the one and the same thing.
 
 3.1
 Deployment diagrams identify the components deployed on each hardware.
 MySQL server needs a box around it, if it is running on seperate hardware.
 Identifiers should be the same in 3.1.2 and 3.1.1.
 3.1.2 is good, just needs an identifier change.
 Program 1 and program 2 should be replaced with actual names, these are place holders for the document template.
 Web application name should be found in QA documents (Walking Tour Displayer?).
 The labelled arrows should also use the same identifiers as the other diagrams.
 
 User Interface is missing from the breakdown, a fine description of it should be done.
 
 5.2
 For each algorithm, the class/method to which it belongs to needs to be specified.
 
 5.3
 Not covered during the meeting.
